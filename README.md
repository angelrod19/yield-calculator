# Return on Investment Calculator
This python script ("run.py") uses an algorithm to calculate return on investment based on monthly contribution, expected monthly return in percentage, and timeframe.

In the following example, the investor starts with $10,000. He expects a 5% return while adding $100 every month. The script displays the projection and total amount after the desired number of years (4 in this case).

Attached is also "daily.py", which is the same concept but using compound interest on a dailt basis.
